## Abstract

Fishes have repeatedly evolved characteristic body shapes depending on how close they live to the substrate. Pelagic fishes live and feed in open water and typically have narrow, streamlined body shapes; benthic and demersal fishes live in close association with the substrate and often have deeper bodies. These shape differences are often associated with behavioral differences: pelagic fishes swim nearly constantly, demersal fishes tend to maneuver near the substrate, and fully benthic fishes often lie in wait on the substrate. We hypothesized that these morphological and behavioral differences would be reflected in the mechanical properties of the vertebral column, with pelagic fishes having stiffer vertebral columns than the others. The vertebrae of bony fishes are composed of two cones connected by a foramen, which is filled by the notochord. Since the notochord is much more flexible than the bony vertebral centra, we predicted that pelagic fishes would have narrower foramina or shallower cones, which would reduce the amount of flexible notochord, and should cause them to have stiffer vertebral columns to support continuous swimming behavior. To test this hypothesis, we examined differences in vertebral morphology in 55 species from the three habitat categories by measuring vertebrae along the length of the body of each fish based on micro-computed tomography scans. From these scans, six vertebral features were measured: notochordal foramen diameter, centrum body length, and the cone angles and diameters for the anterior and posterior vertebral cones. Using a phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) analysis to control for phylogeny, we found that notochordal foramen diameter and posterior cone angle differed significantly among species from benthic, demersal, and pelagic habitats. Benthic species had significantly larger posterior cone angles than other fishes, while pelagic species had significantly smaller notochordal foramen diameters. Thus, morphological differences in the internal shape of the vertebrae of fishes are consistent with a stiffer vertebral column in pelagic fishes, which could support the behavioral differences across benthic, demersal, and pelagic species.
